## its on the cloud @ [live link](https://spacexapi-test-ra.surge.sh).

### Initially built out with MUI and SCSS to prove scope and methodology for a totally custom frontend.

### How many components?  just two, but favored the utility of ReactQuery to facilitate some of those awesome  and simple way to set up fetch, caching, error trapping and any possible CRUD features that may be needed

### APIs:  used two spacex's open APIs.  

## FYI ReactQuery Api Dev tools are pluged to test against data calls

### Given more time, better SEO/Usability/UX/Accessibility could have been covered.initially its responsive with some SCSS variables setup, lots of room to scale given this initial architecture setup

### Component testing:  not set up at this time. 

### built in Vite & TSX intially with SCSS, MUI, Axios, ReactQuery & API Hooks
