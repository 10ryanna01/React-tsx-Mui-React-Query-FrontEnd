### 🔧🎨 Initially built out with MUI and SCSS to prove scope and methodology for a totally custom frontend. 

### 💻💡 How many components?  Just two, but favored the utility of ReactQuery to facilitate some awesome and simplified methods it enables for setting up get/fetch, caching, error handeling and future options for CRUD management features 💻💡

### APIs:  used two spacex's open APIs.  🔮 🌌

## FYI ReactQuery Api Dev tools are pluged to test against data calls 💡💻💡
